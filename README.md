#### This repo contains code for the first portion of the SDEV485 Advise-It tool project.
- The tool is to be used as an aid for advisors and students. 
- Advisors will create a one-year schedule with the student which will be reachable via a unique token generated for the schedule. 
- The schedule will be retrievable by that token by either the advisor or student. 
- The schedule will be editable by either the student or the advisor.
